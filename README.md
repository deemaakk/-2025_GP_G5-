# Laّweh لوّح

## Introduction
Laّweh is an innovative mobile application powered by artificial intelligence, created to support the deaf and hard-of-hearing community across Arabic-speaking regions. Recognizing the communication barriers faced by over 229,000 individuals with hearing impairments in Saudi Arabia alone, Laّweh provides practical solutions that promote inclusivity and accessibility.

The app serves dual purposes: as a communication tool and an educational platform. Users can translate ArSL letters from images into Arabic text and speech, making daily interactions smoother and more natural. The reverse feature allows spoken or typed Arabic to be displayed as ArSL letter demonstrations, helping non-signers communicate effectively with the deaf community.

What sets Laّweh apart is its comprehensive educational approach. Interactive lessons, informative articles, and engaging quizzes help users learn ArSL at their own pace. The "Play with Laّweh" section adds a fun, gamified dimension with Memory Match and Build the Word activities, making sign language learning an enjoyable experience for all ages.
By combining cutting-edge AI technology with user-centered design, Laّweh empowers communication, reduces social barriers, and builds bridges between communities.
